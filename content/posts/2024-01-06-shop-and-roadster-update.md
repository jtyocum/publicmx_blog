The shop is coming along. Installed heat some weeks back, just a simple 18K BTU diesel fuel heater. It's not perfect, but it does take the chill off. More recently, setup an old computer to make it easier to look up documentation, part specs, etc. I had been using my laptop on occassion, but didn't want to get a greasy finger prints on it.

As for the roadster project, it's going slowly, but it is moving along. The suspension, brakes, and steering are assembled. Though, some need to be set to final torque. Currently working on pedals and steering column. Then back to sheet metal work. Should be ordering tires and remaining engine parts soon, though I do have an oil pan on the way.
