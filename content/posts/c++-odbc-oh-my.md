title: "C++, ODBC, Oh My...."

Recently found myself wanting to "relearn" C++. And, with that I needed the ability store data. Instead of tying myself to a particular storage format, or database engine, I opted to use ODBC. After reviewing several options for ODBC abstractions, I ended up selecting [OTL](http://otl.sourceforge.net/) (ODBC Template Library).

From tools standpoint, I'm using Emacs + [Eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) + clangd. To keep my code looking "consistent", I'm using clang-format. With all development working being done under Linux, currently Fedora.
