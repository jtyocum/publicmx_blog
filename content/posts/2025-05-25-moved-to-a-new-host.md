Until recently, I have been hosting my blog and other services on ColoCrossing. Unfortunately, their VPS service has [been hacked](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/205968/colocrossing-database-breach). They are claiming that services were taken offline to prevent further issues, however, others have posted screenshots from the hackers indicating they may have deleted some customer data.

So, in the interest of getting things back online, I opted to move everything to a new host. It's a bit more expensive than what I was paying (I had been on a holiday special plan), but the performance is much better.
