title: "ThinkPad X395 Update"

It's been 6 months since I purchased my ThinkPad X395, and I felt it was time to make an update on the experience. Specs:

* AMD Ryzen 5 Pro 3500U
* 8GB DDR4
* 256GB NVME
* 1920x1080 IPS (non-touch)
* Intel 9260 Wireless
* Fingerprint Reader

I've been running Fedora on the laptop since the day I received it. Initially the fingerprint reader didn't work with Linux. However, after a few months the Linux fingerprint library gained support for the reader (with the help of Lenovo and Synaptics). Overall the experience has been quite good.

As for battery life, I'm not really sure. I've never run out of battery, even after using it from several hours. The estimated battery life as reported by GNOME, seems to be a bit inacurrate.

So, what doesn't work? I haven't tried the TPM chip. But, the kernel does detect it, so it probably works.
