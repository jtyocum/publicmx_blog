It's true! The new garage is almost finished. It's taken over a year to get to this point. The main delay was permitting related, both on the city side and the contractor side. The initial design proposal didn't meet code requirements, and some negotiating was required. From there, we had delays due to employees being out sick (understandable), and general site plan issues. Once those were sorted, the project picked up speed. Now, we're simply waiting on the door and gutters to be installed. That, and I've got to finish painting. But, that's a relatively quick task with a sprayer.
